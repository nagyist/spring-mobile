# Spring Mobile

[Spring Mobile] is an extension of the [Spring Framework] and [Spring Web MVC] that aims to simplify the development of mobile web applications.


## Features

- A device resolver abstraction for server-side detection of mobile and tablet devices

- Site preference management that allows the user to indicate if he or she prefers a "normal", "mobile", or "tablet" experience

- A site switcher capable of switching the user to the most appropriate site, either mobile, tablet, or normal, based on his or her device and optionally indicated site preference

- Device aware view management for organizing and managing different views for specific devices


## Download Artifacts

Include the `spring-mobile-starter` in your Spring Boot application to enable Spring Mobile's Auto-Configuration. See [downloading Spring artifacts] for Maven repository information. Unable to use Maven or other transitive dependency management tools? See [building a distribution with dependencies].


### Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile("org.springframework.mobile:spring-mobile-starter:2.0.0.M2")
}
repositories {
    maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/milestone" }
}
```

### Maven

## Sample Applications

Several example projects are available in the [samples repository].


## Getting Started Guides

The [spring.io] web site contains many [getting started guides][guides] that cover a broad range of topics. 

- [Serving Mobile Web Content with Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-mobile-web-content/)
- [Detecting a Device](https://spring.io/guides/gs/device-detection/)
- [Handling Web Site Preference](https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-site-preference/)


## Support

Review the [spring-mobile][spring-mobile tag] tag on [Stack Overflow].


## Issue Tracking

Report issues via [GitHub issues]. Understand our issue management process by reading about [the lifecycle of an issue].


## Build from Source

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-mobile.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

    ```sh
    $ cd spring-mobile
    ```

3. The project uses [Gradle] to build:

    ```sh
    $ ./gradlew build
    ```
        
4. Install jars into your local Maven cache (optional)

    ```sh
    $ ./gradlew install
    ```


## Import Source into your IDE

### Eclipse

1. To generate Eclipse metadata (.classpath and .project files):

    ```sh
    $ ./gradlew eclipse
    ```

2. Once complete, you may then import the projects into Eclipse as usual:

   ```
   File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace
   ```

> **Note**: [Spring Tool Suite][sts] has built in support for [Gradle], and you can simply import as Gradle projects.

### IDEA

Generate IDEA metadata (.iml and .ipr files):

```sh
$ ./gradlew idea
```
